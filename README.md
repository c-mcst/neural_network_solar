## A demonstration of using TensorFlow and Keras to predict solar panel power output

Welcome. This is a small project I did using TensorFlow to see how well I could predict the power output of the solar panels on my house. I train two models: a linear regression model, and a simple deep neural network. I compare the loss from each model to get an idea of how much I've improved my predictions, and I do some speculation about where this project should go in the future if I really want to know how much power my solar panels will be putting out in a given half hour.

The Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb extension) should show you most of what you want to know. I've done my best to comment and document thoroughly so that you can follow along. If you want to run this notebook yourself, the two data files in CSV format included in this repo should be all you need. Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions.
